Bonus :
- REPL mode
- function definition

For REPL mode `--additionals=REPL`. REPL mode is just a REPL mode for Abacus. Doesn't support rpn mode.

For function definition `--additionals=FUNCDEF`. FUNCDEF adds function definition. You can define a function with the operator `#` immediately followed by the name of the function, and then followed by the arguments wrapped in parenthesis and comma-separated, after just put `=` and the function expression (e.g "#f(x, y) = x + y"). You cannot redefine a function. You can use functions in function definition but no recursion.

FUNCDEF is compatible with REPL.
